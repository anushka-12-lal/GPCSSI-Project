OSINT – Open Source Intelligence, provides you an open platform for seeking information about an individual or any subject of interest from public resources that include social networking sites, forums, blogs, videos and news sites. 

We do have large number of OSINT tools available, each focusing on only one aspect of investigation. For eg: tool to verify email address, extract user info from email address, find specified username’s linking with other platforms online. All these tools are scattered around different websites. This can be tiresome sometimes because we have to first keep record of all the OSINT tool available on each site and then depending on what we need we have keep switching between them. 

But what if we try to bring together similar tools in the same platform for easier study of our investigation data? 

Since most readily and easily available information about the target is his IP address we have tried to bring together some tools that will help us gather information about the target simply from his IP address or domain id. 

Features:

1.	Details of the website using domain name or IP address
2.	Find IP address using domain name
3.	Trace the location of target using his IP address
4.	Port Scanner
